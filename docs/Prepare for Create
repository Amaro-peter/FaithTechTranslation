# Redemptive Technology Training

## Introduction

We believe there is a way of building technology that redemptively changes the world while transforming those who build it. This set of video trainings will help prepare you to lead each of the 4D Cycle sessions within your community for your Create cycle.

## How to Use This Training

Each video training below provides a detailed walkthrough of each week of a 4D Cycle. While this material attempts to be all-inclusive, you may find yourself with more questions. If you need further assistance to get prepared for your Create cycle, reach out to your Regional Manager.
