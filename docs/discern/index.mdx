# Overview

In this stage, we involve the wisdom of God, testing and refining our approach continually.

> We recognize that true discernment often comes from beyond our own frames of reference, and we seek to uncover and understand the will of God.
>
> — The FaithTech Playbook

We look to move from human-centered thinking to God-centered wisdom.

:::info[Romans 12:2]

Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
