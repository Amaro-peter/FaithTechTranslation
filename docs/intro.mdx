# Redemptive Technology Workbook

## Introduction

Welcome to the Redemptive Technology Workbook! This guide is designed to help you apply the principles of redemptive technology in your work.

## Redemptive Technology Design

At FaithTech, we believe there is a way of building technology that redemptively changes the world while transforming those who build it. Our community has developed a uniquely Jesus-centered way to build that is laid out in the FaithTech Playbook.

This framework is mapped out in what we call the 4D Cycle.
