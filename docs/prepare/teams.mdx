# Forming Teams

Creating effective teams is crucial for the success of your Create projects.

## Assessing Skills and Experiences

To create well-rounded teams:

1. Conduct a skills inventory:

   - Technical skills (e.g., programming languages, design tools)
   - Soft skills (e.g., communication, leadership, empathy)
   - Domain expertise relevant to the project

2. Consider past experiences:

   - Previous redemptive technology projects
   - Volunteer work or community involvement
   - Professional background

3. Identify areas for growth:
   - Skills team members want to develop
   - Opportunities for mentorship within the team

Exercise: Create a skills matrix for your community, mapping individuals to their strengths and areas for growth.

## Balancing Technical and Non-Technical Roles

Aim for a mix of roles such as:

- Technical roles:

  - Software developers
  - UX/UI designers
  - Data analysts
  - DevOps

- Non-technical roles:
  - Prayer leads
  - Project managers
  - Community liaisons
  - Subject matter experts

Exercise: For your project, list the essential roles needed. Identify any gaps in your current team and strategize how to fill them.

## Defining Team Roles and Responsibilities

Clear roles help teams function smoothly:

1. Define key responsibilities for each role
2. Establish decision-making processes
3. Create a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix for major project tasks
4. Allow for flexibility as the project evolves

Exercise: Create a RACI matrix for your project, ensuring all major tasks have clear ownership and involvement.

## Integrating Faith

To integrate faith into your team dynamics:

1. Start meetings with prayer or devotional reflections
1. Emphasize that our work should always point to Jesus
1. Highlight the importance of being Spirit-led in decision-making
1. Encourage team members to share with and pray for each other

At FaithTech, these core pillars define everything we do:

1. It all points back to Jesus
1. Led by the Spirit
1. Take a sacrificial posture
1. People over Products
1. Don't take ourselves too seriously

Exercise: Develop values that will guide your team's work and decision-making.

## Reflection Questions

- Are we being obedient to the Holy Spirit as we build out our teams?
- Are we leveraging the diverse gifts and experiences God has given our community members?
- How can we ensure that every team member feels valued and has opportunities to contribute meaningfully?

Remember, forming a team for a 4D cycle project is not just about assembling skills, but about bringing together individuals who can collectively pursue technology development in a way that honors God and serves others.
