# Overview

In this final stage, we redefine impact as friendship compounded by time and measure and demonstrate our impact redemptively.

Depth with Jesus, depth with each other - that is ultimately what we at FaithTech are 
seeking as we practice redemptive technology design in community.

>  **We believe there is a way of building technology that redemptively changes the world while transforming those who build it. We believe this because we believe in a Savior who sacrificed himself willingly to love and serve us and who calls us to this way of life.**
