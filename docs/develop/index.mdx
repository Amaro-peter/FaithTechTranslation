# Overview

In this stage, we recognize that God establishes our steps to develop the solution, and we co-develop with the Holy Spirit.

> What we need already exists in God, and through the Holy Spirit, he will reveal this to us, so that what is not yet visible can be brought into view.
>
> — The FaithTech Playbook

Every step of the way, we look to the Holy Spirit to reveal His plan and inspire our work.

:::info[Hebrews 11:3]

By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
