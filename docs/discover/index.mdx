# Overview

In this stage, we reorient ourselves to see, through the lens of Christ, those most affected by the problem. We position ourselves humbly through a practice of lament.

> In the FaithTech community, a problem is commonly expressed through lament. As innovators, we tend to run to the solution. But we press pause on that tendency for a moment.

> â€” The FaithTech Playbook

A great example of a Lament can be found from Nehemiah reaction to seeing the destruction of the walls in Jerusalem.

:::info[Nehemiah 1:5-6]

Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night.
