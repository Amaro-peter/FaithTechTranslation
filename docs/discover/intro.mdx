# Overview

In this stage, we reorient ourselves to see, through the lens of Christ, those most affected by the problem. We position ourselves humbly through a practice of lament.

_“By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible”_
**Hebrews 11:3**
