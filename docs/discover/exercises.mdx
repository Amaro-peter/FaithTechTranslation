# Exercises

You'll walk through exercises for the Discover stage.

## Exercise 1: Problem Identification

1. Identify a problem you want to work on. Refer to the [projects page](/prepare/projects) for guidance.
2. Write a brief description of the problem (2-3 sentences). Start with a partner challenge statement if you have one.
3. List at least three groups of people who are most affected by this problem.

## Exercise 2: Lament Practice

Follow these steps to craft a lament for the problem you identified:

1. Address God
2. Describe the problem to Him
3. Recall testimony of God's faithfulness
4. Petition Him
5. Ask for God's intervention
6. Praise Him in advance

Work on the lament as a team. We suggest you talk it out and have one person take notes.
