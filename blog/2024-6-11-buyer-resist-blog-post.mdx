Buyer Resist started at a FaithTech hackathon with a group of people who cared deeply about stopping human trafficking.

Their approach to this problem was to build tech redemptively to help address a foundational issue: the demand.

Progressing from a website to a chatbot, the team prototyped their solutions together in community - using their faith and skills in concert. With the tech they've built, they are able to intercept men seeking to buy sex online and help them understand that the intimacy they are seeking can't be found with an escort.

The project has moved from prototype to a nonprofit organization with a sustainable model. Buyer Resist is seeking to share a message of hope and redemption, and see men recover from addiction - reducing the demand that fuels human trafficking.
